# Wordsquared Bot

I wrote this in [February 2012](http://oddfactor.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/cheating-robots-wordsquared/). The main reason was I suck at playing games.

In the beginning, I decided not to release this program as the game was quite new and I didn't want to disrupt the game. But now I publish this for educational purpose as [Wordsquared](http://www.wordsquared.com/) (W^2) is now [closed](https://getsatisfaction.com/wordsquared/topics/saying_goodbye_to_wordsquared). 

Very unfortunate. Wordsquared was a great game. One of the few online game that I actually played.

Thank you, Massively Fun!
